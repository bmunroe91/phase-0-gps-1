## What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Overall organization, knowing where I'm forking from or where I'm pushing to... That's not exactly true, but I still need to get into the habit of best practices.
## What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
I was unaware that git push is a combination of git fetch and git merge.
## What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I was unsure when to make a pull request when working with my pair as I had only done work with myself prior to this session.
## What still confuses you about git?
I still want to make sure I know what I'm cloning, where I'm cloning to, making sure its the right version, right directory etc.
## How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was awesome. My pair knew what they were doing, and I think we both gained knowledge working together.
