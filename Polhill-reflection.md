
####What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
I got a better idea for how fetch and merge work in contrast to pull, as well as how a pair of people would work together to accomplish a task in GitHub. 

####What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
Most of the questions were about what is best practice.

####What still confuses you about git?
I feel pretty comfortable with git, I can't think of anything that confuses me. But I'm sure something will pop up eventually.

####How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It takes a bit of getting use to having a driver-navigating pair, but it was fun and I can see how it is useful.
